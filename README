Transformer in Pytorch

My goal with this model is to for it to be reasonably good at translating 1-3 sentences in English to Spanish
Which is how 99% of people use translators, imo
I am using a much smaller version of transformer described in the paper, the exact params are in train.py.

I will upload the weights when it's done training

TODO
- Solve convergence issues. Try training with a smaller model to partial convergence

DEBUGGING POOR CONVERGENCE

- Not masking
- Not encoder...
- Not positional
- Not FF (fixed)
