Transformer in Pytorch

My goal with this model is to for it to be reasonably good at translating 1-3 sentences in English to Spanish
Which is how 99% of people use translators, imo
I am using a much smaller version of transformer described in the paper, the exact params are in train.py.

TODO
- Implement batching
- good pprint
- wandb
- finally train???1
